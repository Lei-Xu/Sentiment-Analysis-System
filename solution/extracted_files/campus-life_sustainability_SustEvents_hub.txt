{'title': 'campus-life_sustainability_SustEvents_hub', 'url': 'https://www.concordia.ca/campus-life/sustainability/SustEvents/hub.html', 'content': '\nMission\nThe Concordia Sustainability hub workgroup is an open-door collective of motivated Concordians who aim to actively support each other, individuals and groups working towards creating a culture of sustainability by:\nEnhancing awareness and visibility of sustainability initiatives on campus;\nProviding opportunities for collaboration and resource sharing for \xa0sustainability initiatives;\nProvide a variety of insights into University affairs relating to sustainability;\nPromoting the various sustainability initiatives on campus;\nServing as the selection committee of the\xa0Sustainability Champions Awards\xa0to recognize and celebrate sustainability efforts on campus.\nThe idea for the Sustainability hub workgroup arose out of a desire for greater communication between people working on different sustainability initiatives at Concordia. As interest in sustainability continues to grow and more initiatives develop, it is important for the key stakeholders in sustainability to maintain strong communication ties. This enables stakeholders to be informed on the sustainability initiatives of various groups or departments around campus in order to maximize collaboration and resource sharing.\nConcordia Graduate Student Association\nConcordia Institute for Water, Energy and Sustainable Systems\nConcordia Student Union\nCEED\nDean of Students\nEnvironmental Health and Safety\nThe John Molson Sustainable Enterprise Committee\nLoyola College for Diversity and Sustainability\nOffice of Community Engagement\nSustainable Concordia\nSustainability Action Fund\nThe Concordia Sustainability Hub Workgroup is an open group at Concordia that is always looking for new interested members.\nIf you or your department/group/association would like to join the Hub Workgroup, please send an email to sustainability@concordia.ca.\nEnvironmental, Health & Safety:\xa0\n514-848-2424, ext. 4877\n514-848-2807\n\nehs@concordia.ca \nStaff directory\nQuestions, comments or concerns?\nPlease fill out this\xa0form\nReport an injury or a near-miss\n\nMSDS/SDS\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nSustainability Hub Workgroup\nContact us\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n                    History\n                \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n                    Membership\n                \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n                    How to get involved\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nEnhancing awareness and visibility of sustainability initiatives on campus;\n\nProviding opportunities for collaboration and resource sharing for \xa0sustainability initiatives;\n\nProvide a variety of insights into University affairs relating to sustainability;\n\nPromoting the various sustainability initiatives on campus;\n\nServing as the selection committee of the\xa0Sustainability Champions Awards\xa0to recognize and celebrate sustainability efforts on campus.\n\nSustainability Events and ActivitiesSustainability Hub Workgroup\nSustainability Hub Workgroup\n\n'}
