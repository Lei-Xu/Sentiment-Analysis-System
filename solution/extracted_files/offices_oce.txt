These initiatives are diverse in nature and require different types of involvement on the part of the OCE and-or Concordia. For the purpose of determining allocation of OCE and Concordia resources as well as the desired level of institutional affiliation, the levels of involvement have been identified:\nWhen the OCE agrees to introduce the organizers of a community engagement initiative to the University unit best positioned to address their request, it agrees to conduct the necessary research, to contact the appropriate internal unit in order to assess their capacity to respond to the request and, then, to connect the individuals involved directly with one another.\nWhen the OCE agrees to promote a community engagement initiative, it agrees to informally disseminate the information through OCE/Concordia channels.\nWhen the OCE agrees to support a community engagement initiative, it agrees to provide a financial contribution and/or the use of Concordia facilities at a discounted rate. Supported initiatives will also be informally promoted through OCE/Concordia channels. \xa0\nWhen the OCE agrees to partner with a community engagement initiative, it agrees to take part in designing the initiative and/or its associated content. This may involve links to Concordia-led research, student initiatives or other university experts. The OCE will typically be involved throughout the initiative and may provide financial support and/or the use of Concordia facilities at a discounted rate.\nWhen the OCE agrees to incubate a community engagement initiative, it agrees to support the initiative’s emergence through a proof-of-concept exercise and/or through the development of necessary capacities. The impetus for incubation may result from internal or external opportunities that are deemed to fall within the mandate of the OCE. Such initiatives are rolled directly into the OCE’s budget, strategic plan and individual staff work plans.\nWhen deciding to partner on a new community engagement initiative, in addition to reflecting on fit with the above definition, the OCE considers the following:\nSenior Director of the Office of Community Engagement – Charmaine Lyn\n\nCharmaine leads the Office of Community Engagement in its mandate to support and promote community-engaged scholarship, community-based research and community-engaged learning at Concordia.
