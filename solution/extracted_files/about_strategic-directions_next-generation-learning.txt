They also want learning opportunities that allow them to work creatively and collaboratively on our society’s most complex challenges. The pilots and experiments in this project will help us provide these opportunities and achieve our strategic direction to “teach for tomorrow.”\nNew opportunities for faculty to hone their skills in handling contentious social issues in class, engaging racial and gender diversity, indigenizing courses and curriculum, and utilizing Universal Design for Learning.
