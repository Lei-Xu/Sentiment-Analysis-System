Students investigate how theatre artists might collaborate with other disciplines to explore social change within specific organizations and/or neighbourhoods. This course has a site specific public performance outcome. \n\nContact:\xa0edward.little@concordia.ca\n\xa0\n\xa0\nFine Arts - Design and Computation Arts\nA special project-based studio that provides students the opportunities to dialogue with and engage with Montreal-based outreach programs, community centres and not-for-profit organizations.
