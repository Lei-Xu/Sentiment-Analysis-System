Our faculty-wide events, including the\xa0Beyond Disciplines public discussion series, attract audiences through eye-opening and engaging interdisciplinary research.\nWe are also leading the way in offering students access to unique, hands-on learning opportunities as with our Jurist-in-Residence program. Having a jurist of Judge Minc’s stature join our faculty is a great honour and students have had the wonderful opportunity to benefit from his many years of experience in law and social justice issues.\nOther exciting FAS projects include\xa0Montreal 2050, a hub for research and action with the goal of creating a city at the leading edge of urban design and planning.\nTo keep tabs on all inspirational initiatives, bookmark our news page, follow us on Twitter, and join our Facebook group.\xa0\nLastly, I wish to extend a warm welcome to all students who are joining us for the first time.
