Sugimoto of Indiana University with discussant Shelley Reuter, Associate Professor, Sociology and Anthropology. Free and open to the public.\nPart of the series "Science in the Age of Pluralism," which aims to examine our scientific approaches so we can imagine how we can better meet the challenges posed in an age of pluralism.\nSugimoto researches within the domain of scholarly communication and scientometrics, examining the formal and informal ways in which knowledge producers consume and disseminate scholarship. She has co-edited two volumes and has published 50 journal articles on this topic. Her work has been presented at numerous conferences and has received research funding from the National Science Foundation, Institute for Museum and Library Services, and the Sloan Foundation, among other agencies. Sugimoto is actively involved in teaching and service and has been rewarded in these areas with an Indiana University Trustees Teaching award (2014) and a national service award from the Association for Information Science and Technology (2009). Sugimoto has an undergraduate degree in music performance, an M.S. in library science, and a Ph.D. in information and library science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\nShelley Z. Reuter began as Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Concordia University in 2003 and received tenure and promotion to Associate in 2007. Prior to joining Concordia University, she was a faculty member at Memorial University of Newfoundland and at Queen’s University, where she also earned her PhD (2001). She has done qualitative research in the historical sociology of medicine and particularly the production of medical knowledge in relation to disease and cultural classifications such as "race" and gender. Dr. Reuter\'s new research looks at "wellness" promotion and responsibilization in the context of campus student health clinics and university Employee Assistance Programs. A third area of interest is in motherhood and childlessness; Reuter is completing a project on childlessness and reproductive decision-making and beginning a new study of mothers who leave their children. Dr. Reuter teaches at both the graduate and undergraduate levels.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nThis talk, "A gendered science?" features Cassidy R.
