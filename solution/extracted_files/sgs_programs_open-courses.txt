How is identity politically, socially, and culturally positioned in relation to otherness, in and through the circuits of cultural exchange that bring communities into encounters that are both powerful and threatening? These questions are poignant in the contemporary geopolitical context, under the conditions of continued domination and exploitation, the emergence of new right-wing populisms, newly inflamed culture wars and state and non-state sponsored forms of violence, as well as in the search for new forms of belonging, survival and thriving in the 21st century. This doctoral seminar is organized as a “toolbox” course, examining how the politics of recognition open us both to the social relations that found human subjectivity, as well as to how asymmetrical forms of recognition may lead to misrecognition or injury. We will trace together a) the concept of “recognition” back to its origins, in the work of G.W.F. Hegel (as well as through Alexandre Kojève and Herbert Marcuse and others), b) foundational critiques within critical accounts of race (Frantz Fanon, C.L.R. James) and gender (Simone de Beauvoir, Sylvia Wynter, Judith Butler), c) its elaboration and field of debates within discourses of multiculturalism and identity politics (Charles Taylor, Nancy Fraser, Seyla Benhabib), d) and challenges to the structures of recognition in contemporary examinations of identity and cultural exchange within critical race studies (Moten, Sexton, Hartman, Sharpe), feminist and queer theory (Butler, Muñoz, Halberstam, Preciado), Indigenous studies (Coulthard, Simpson, Tallbear), postcolonial theory (Bhabha, Mbembe, Chakrabarty, Mohanty), and posthumanism (Haraway, Tsing, Chen). Ultimately, students will develop together a language for addressing the politics of difference and identity in the contexts of contemporary cultural exchange, attentive to the political, economic, cultural and ethical stakes of such investigations. We will complement this theoretical work with concrete cultural examples that flesh out and enrich our theoretical investigations.\nSpecial instructions: Priority will be given to graduate students in Communication Studies. For all other students, registration is subject to permission of the course instructor (Krista Lynes).\xa0\nContact: Krista Lynes\nOffered: 2018 /2\nCredits: 3\nThis course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the SAS analytic software for Windows. Through a mixture of lectures and in-class examples and exercises, students will gain experience using the SAS system for data management and analysis. Emphasis will be placed on the skills and techniques necessary for efficient data management and analysis. It is designed for students with little to no background with SAS. Students must have an understanding of the basic statistical concepts.\nPrerequisites:\xa0STAT 360 (or an equivalent course on linear models) and a course on statistics.\nSpecial instructions: This course will be relevant to students who wish to analyze their thesis data using SAS (as an alternative to SPSS or R). As the course is entirely devoted to data management and analysis using SAS, students must have previous knowledge of hypothesis testing and statistic (including regression models).\xa0\nContact:\xa0Lisa Kakinami\nOffered: 2018 /2\nCredits: 3\nDante was not a professional philosopher but he was seriously engaged with philosophy and this engagement was essential to his work as a whole. Moreover, Dante (1265-1321) lived at a very special time. This is the time when Aristotle’s philosophy and science were made available for the first time to the Latin West. For the above reasons, we will read selections from the Convivio and Divina Commedia. We will try to reconstruct Dante’s philosophical outlook, which is an eclectic form of Aristotelianism tempered by an infusion of Christian thought.\nSpecial instructions:\xa0Knowledge of Italian or Latin is not required to do well in this class. However, willingness to engage in close and attentive reading of complex works as well as ability to do independent research outside class are absolutely essential to your success in this course.\nCourse may of interest to students in English, CMLL, and Italian Studies.\nContact:\xa0Emma Moss Brender\nNote: Priority will be given to students in the Political Science PhD and MPPPA programs. Interested students must obtain permission to enroll from the professor.\nOffered: Summer,\xa0Fall, Winter (2017, 2018, 2019)\nCredits: 3\nThis course provides a unique opportunity for students to take a selection of the Workshops on Social Science Research (WSSR) offered by the Department of Political Science for credit.\nThe WSSR are intensive short learning experiences designed to enhance your knowledge and skills in the areas of democratic governance and public policy. These workshops are led by highly reputable and insightful guest lecturers from well-known academic institutions and/or well-qualified and distinguished backgrounds. For this course, you must select, register in, and attend six workshops, as well as complete all the requirements listed in this outline below.\nPrerequisites:\xa0Graduate students from all faculties are welcome to take the WSSR for credit. Be sure to consult with your Graduate Program Director (GPD) in order to confirm that you are eligible to receive credit toward your degree. Please email confirmation of eligibility from your GPD to\xa0wssr@concordia.ca\xa0once you have completed and submitted your "Permission Request" form (see below). See a list of\xa0Concordia GPDs and GPAs.\nSpecial instructions:\nOffered:\xa02019 /4\nCredits: 3\nThis writing seminar aims to help students who have already carried out ethnographic field research transform their fieldnotes into ethnographic writing, develop their own ethnographic voice and adopt a productive writing routine. The course encourages students to cultivate a critical and reflexive approach to ethnographic writing, and to master the art of building an anthropological argument by drawing on their own ethnographic findings.\nThe seminar encourages peer-to-peer learning as well as learning through doing, and is designed to help students progress in the writing up of their dissertation. It therefore has an important practical component: the writing load is very heavy and the reading load, a little less so. As they develop their writing skills, students will also learn to assess and engage with other forms of ethnographic writing, through readings and peer-reviews, and to situate their own ethnography in relation to relevant bodies of literature. They will also develop their oral presentation skills by presenting their work and discussing the work of their colleagues. Only students who have already conducted ethnographic field research, and who therefore have their own research material to work with, can sign-up for this seminar.\nSpecial instructions:\xa0Priority will be given to graduate students in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology. For all other students, registration is subject to permission of the course instructor (Julie Archambault).\nContact: Julie Archambault\nOffered:\xa02019 /1\xa0\nCredits: 3\nThe current political and media landscape has social scientists and pundits perplexed as to how to explain the tenacity of deeply opposing world views and truth claims threatening the stability of liberal democracies around the world. The course raises two kinds of questions for in depth discussion: 1. What are the diversity of approaches (political economy, field theory; cultural sociology, actor network theory; critical sociology; postructuralism, posthumanism) that study these divisions through media and crisis in politics and journalism (professional work culture, technology, aesthetic, discourse, organization, ideology). And 2. Have journalism, politics, and social science contributed in some way to the present divisiveness? Each of these disciplines (or interdisciplines) are first level observers of events, but each has a different interest in sources, constituents, and/or actors/actants as well as in the relations between fact, opinion, and truth. Does the existence of conflicting views represent a strength or weakness in social science? Will democratic politics survive the next internet? Is journalism a parasite of civil society, or on the front line of ‘resistance’ to power?\nSpecial instructions:\xa0Priority will be given to graduate students in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology.
