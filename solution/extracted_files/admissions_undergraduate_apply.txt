If we are missing your test scores, we will send you a letter requesting the scores.\nNormally, you will have three weeks to submit your results from that point. If you are unable to meet that deadline, but you are scheduled to take an English proficiency test, please upload a copy of your scheduled or planned test date.\nPlease note that we will not consider any applications missing English proficiency test scores after July 31 for Fall (September) entry and December 1 for Winter (January) entry. \nMany programs have\xa0departmental requirements\xa0that you must satisfy in addition to Concordia’s minimum admission requirements. Additional requirements might include portfolios, auditions, interviews, letters of intent, etc.\nYou must make arrangements to submit these additional requirements with the department you apply to.\nPlease\xa0consult the specific program page\xa0for more information on these requirements.\nThe academic year is based on three sessions: summer, fall, and winter.\nCongratulations!

We will evaluate your choices in the order you specify.\nYour first choice should be your top choice. If you don’t get accepted to your first choice, we’ll automatically consider your other choices, in the order that you specify.\nPick a new subject for each choice. For example, don't choose the honours, specialization and major in the same subject (e.g. Psychology) for your three choices. If you don't meet the requirements for the honours, we'll automatically consider you for the specialization or the major instead.\nAdmission requirements for some programs are exactly the same (for example, all John Molson School of Business degree programs and Aerospace Engineering programs).
