Long-term plans and goals will be developed in consultation with the university community.\nProgress will be monitored and periodically reported in the spirit of accountability and transparency. Every five years, the policy will undergo review by the Sustainability Advisory Committee, with input from Concordia's community.\n\xa0\nBy S.
