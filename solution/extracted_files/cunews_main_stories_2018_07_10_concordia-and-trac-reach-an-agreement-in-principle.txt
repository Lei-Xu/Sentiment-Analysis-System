I look forward to building on this positive relationship with TRAC.”\n\xa0\n\nConcordia’s professional employees sign a new contract with the university\n\n\nConcordia signs a new collective agreement with support staff\n\n\nConcordia signs a new labour agreement with CUCEPTFU\n\nBy Human Resources and TRAC\nConcordia and TRAC reach an agreement in principle\nRelated topics\nYou might also like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcordia’s professional employees sign a new contract with the university\n\n\n\n\nConcordia signs a new collective agreement with support staff\n\n\n\n\nConcordia signs a new labour agreement with CUCEPTFU\n\n\n\n'}
