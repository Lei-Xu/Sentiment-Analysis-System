Both inside the classroom and out, there are tons of ways to get engaged.\nVolunteering allows you to contribute to a cause you care about and gain valuable experience. Go and meet with a Volunteer Ambassador at Concordia’s LIVE Centre. They will help you navigate through hundreds of volunteer opportunities and help you find the one that's right for you!\nWorking with the community doesn’t always have to happen outside of class time. Community engaged scholarship is a growing field that promotes collaboration between academics and individuals or organizations outside the academy, in the context of partnership and reciprocity. Find out more about community-based learning opportunities at Concordia and ways that you can involve the community in your research.\n\nEvery year, Concordia’s staff, students and faculty host events, run campaigns and raise funds to support a variety of non-profits that serve the community.
