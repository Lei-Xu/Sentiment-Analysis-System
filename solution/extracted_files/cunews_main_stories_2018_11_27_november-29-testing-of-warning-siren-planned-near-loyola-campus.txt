The goal is to test the companyâ€™s warning equipment and the response by its emergency team.\nThe siren test will send out a rising and falling tone that will last three minutes.\n\n Note: there is no action required on your part.\nSince sound is influenced by weather conditions, there is the possibility that the siren will be barely audible in some locations of the targeted area.\nIn the case of a major industrial accident, the warning siren would be immediately activated to advise residents of a dangerous situation within 1,860 metres of the plant. Find out how to prepare yourself in this situation here.\n\nNOV. 29: Testing of warning siren planned near Loyola Campus\nRelated topics\n\n\nnotice\n\n\n\n'}
