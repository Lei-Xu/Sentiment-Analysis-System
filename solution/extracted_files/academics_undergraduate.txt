A major is a more general degree, applicable to many different careers, and allows for the greatest exploration outside of the chosen program.\nMinor: A minor is a sequence of courses totalling 24 or more credits that provides a basic introduction to the methodology and key concepts of a discipline or field (except in the John Molson School of Business where a minor consists of 12 credits in a chosen discipline in addition to the required 42 credit core). Students are not required to take a minor. Completion of one or more minors does not meet the requirements for a degree, but must be done in combination with a major, specialization or honours.\nHonours: An honours program consists of 60 or more credits in a discipline with superior performance required to enter and remain in the program. Honours are highly concentrated programs that are primarily for those planning to pursue graduate studies. Honours programs often require the completion of an independent final project or thesis.\nSpecialization: A specialization is a sequence of courses totalling 60 or more credits. The specialization provides in-depth study for those interested in a career in their chosen field, while still leaving a substantial number of credits to the individualâ€™s choice. In a few cases it includes a performance requirement. In addition to courses in a particular discipline, the specialization may include courses in other related fields.\nCo-op: Co-operative education (Co-op) is a model of experiential learning that bridges university life and the working world. It provides students the chance to combine study with paid work terms in their chosen fields, bringing a wealth of benefits to both students and their employers.\nInterdisciplinary: An interdisciplinary major is a program consisting of credits comprised of courses from a range of disciplines. Interdisciplinary minor programs usually consist of less credits and are to be combined with a department major, specialization, or honours.\nOption (BCompSc & BEng): In the Gina Cody School of Engineering and Computer Science, concentrations are referred to as programs. Most of these programs have options, where students take a number of related courses in a chosen area.\n.\nProgram\nOptions\nM\nm\nH\nS\nco\nI\nUndergraduate programs\nDegree\nProgram type\nSearch\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n                    Legend: Degree abbreviations and definitions\n                \n\n\nProgram type\n\n\nDegree\n\n\nFaculty / School\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n\n\nB\n\n\nC\n\n\nD\n\n\nE\n\n\nF\n\n\nG\n\n\nH\n\n\nI\n\n\nJ\n\n\nK\n\n\nL\n\n\nM\n\n\nN\n\n\nO\n\n\nP\n\n\nQ\n\n\nR\n\n\nS\n\n\nT\n\n\nU\n\n\nV\n\n\nW\n\n\nX\n\n\nY\n\n\nZ\n\n\nM\n\n\nm\n\n\nH\n\n\nS\n\n\nco\n\n\nI\n\n\n\nProgram\n\n\n\n\nOptions\n\n\n'}
