No matter how you progress, it's always about motion.\nIf you're biking, Sustainable Concordia is a wonderful resource to find valuable riding tips and maps to the extensive network of bike paths through the Quartier and throughout Montreal.\nIf you're looking for a bird's eye view of the Quartier, our 'C' wayfinders — located at six spots throughout the neighbourhood — can guide you as you stroll through the community. While you're here, have a look at a map and get to know the area.\nAs the project develops, changes will be made to allow for calmer and safer traffic flow, both for vehicles and bicycles, and a quieter mood for pedestrians.\nThrough our newly expanded network of underground tunnels, our EV, GM, Hall and LB Buildings connect with the Guy-Concordia metro station, the fourth busiest in the network.\xa0Aside from access to the metro system, the station also serves as a major exchange for buses. From here, get on and get anywhere.\nWherever you are or however you're getting there, moving around is half the charm of being here. While you're on your way, feel free to look around.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nThe parallel between the hallways of Concordia's buildings and the streets around them is subtle, yet unmistakable — both act not only as corridors, but as conduits for a spirited flow of life.
