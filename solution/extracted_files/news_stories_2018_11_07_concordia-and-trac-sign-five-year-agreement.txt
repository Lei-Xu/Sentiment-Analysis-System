Congratulations to both teams.”\nThe parties began meeting for negotiations in May 2017 and a memorandum of agreement was signed in June 2018.\nJeremy Tessier, president of the TRAC, was also pleased with the outcome of these negotiations. “Our members help make Concordia a great place to study, and it’s important to take a moment to highlight their contributions and value their labour,” he says.\n“I would like to recognize the former TRAC president Alexandre St-Onge Perron and his counterpart at the bargaining table, vice-provost Nadia Hardy. Their positive leadership has allowed us to make great strides towards fostering a relationship of mutual respect in the bargaining process and beyond.”\nSome of the differences between this and past agreements stem from the fact that TRAC is now one union instead of two (TRAC-TA and TRAC-RA). The unions were amalgamated in 2016. The bargaining teams worked on merging their two collective agreements.\nIt is also a five-year agreement, one of Concordia’s first.\nNadia Hardy, vice-provost of Faculty Development and Inclusion, added that she is pleased to see a five-year agreement, and very proud of the collaborative approach that guided the work of both teams.\n“The five-year term is important in two ways. Firstly, it is a testament to the goodwill exhibited by both teams. Secondly, it provides stability and time for strengthening our working relationship,” she says. “We greatly value research assistants’ and teaching assistants’ contributions to the research and teaching that take place at Concordia.”\nThe collective agreement will be posted on the Concordia web pages shortly.\nThose present for the university: Roger Côté, Govind Gopakumar, Nadia Hardy, JoséEve McCarthy, Alan Shepard, Carolina Willsher. Regrets: Philippe Beauregard, Graham Carr, Denis Cossette, Sonia Coutu.\nThose present for TRAC: Jean-Michel Fortin, Natalie Greenberg, Gonzalo Quintana Zunino, Jeremy Tessier, Marie-Helene Vanier. Regrets: Yvon Barrière, Alexandre St-Onge Perron.\n\xa0\n\nConcordia and TRAC reach an agreement in principle\n\n\nConcordia’s professional employees sign a new contract with the university\n\n\nConcordia signs a new collective agreement with support staff\n\n\nConcordia and TRAC sign a five-year agreement\nRelated topics\nYou might also like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcordia and TRAC reach an agreement in principle\n\n\n\n\nConcordia’s professional employees sign a new contract with the university\n\n\n\n\nConcordia signs a new collective agreement with support staff\n\n\n\n'}
