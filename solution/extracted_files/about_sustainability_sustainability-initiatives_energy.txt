At Concordia, the focus is on ensuring that all buildings are as energy efficient as possible while providing adequate services to the community.\nGreenhouse Gas Inventory\nConcordia University is committed towards minimizing its greenhouse gas emissions level (i.e. “carbon footprint”) through different initiatives such as increased energy efficiency of operations and cleaner energy consumption.\nConcordia’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory includes direct emissions (e.g. heating fuel consumption), indirect emissions (e.g. electricity production and transmission, commuting, landfill waste) and qualitative analysis to raise awareness on potential sources of emissions.\nEmissions were reduced by 7% from 2010-11 to 2014-15. A large part of this was because the university switched some equipment operating on natural gas to electric operated systems. \xa0\nFor more information please consult the report below:\n2014-15 Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report\xa0[PDF - 689 KB]\nMore information related to energy efficiency initiatives at Concordia:\nMore sustainability initiatives related to energy have been implemented at Concordia University; many of which have been led by Facilities Management’s Engineering and Building Performance team.\n\n\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nEnergy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nConcordia News, December 10, 2015:\xa0Unplugged: saving energy over the holidays -\xa0The university is taking conservation measures, including dimming lights and turning down the heat.\nConcordia News, March 24, 2015:\xa0Contribute to a cleaner, cooler, brighter future -\xa0On March 28, turn out the lights during Earth Hour.\nConcordia News, August 25, 2014:\xa0Students design energy-efficient building in nine days -\xa0Intensive summer school course for postgrads focuses on net-zero energy buildings.\nConcordia News, March 18, 2014: Better filtration system for Guy-Metro Building – Replacement of the central cooling plant is underway.\nSustainability initiativesBuildings FoodWasteEnergyWaterTransportationEventsSustainability hub workgroup\nBuildings \nFood\nWaste\nEnergy\nWater\nTransportation\nEvents\nSustainability hub workgroup\n\n'}
