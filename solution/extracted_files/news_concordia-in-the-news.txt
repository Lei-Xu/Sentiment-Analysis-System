Search examples of our faculty, staff, alumni and students, quoted or recognized in the media spotlight. \xa0\nPascale Biron, Professor and Chair of the Department of Geography, Planning and Environment is a renowned expert on waterways & fluid dynamics and how they impact various species and communities - including our own.\nWith each spring thaw comes the inevitable rise of river levels, which can lead to flooding in communities on major riverways in Quebec and Canada. As flood waters rose in communities around Montreal, Biron provided insightfully commentary on the subject for CBC News and Ici Radio-Canada, including a feature story on\xa0Ici Explora.\n\xa0\nGuylaine Vaillancourt,\xa0Associate Professor, Music Therapy, Creative Arts Therapies authored an op-ed appearing in the\xa0La Presse+\xa0as part of a series:\xa0100 Idées pour améliorer le Québec faire rayonner la culture.\xa0\nThe piece discusses the role music plays in our lives, bridging the gap between language and emotion. Within this context Professor Vaillancourt discusses the many ways in which music therapy has helped individuals feel better about themselves, find connection with others and achieve better health outcomes in the process. With short anecdotes about the experiences of real people undergoing music therapy, Professor Vaillancourt demonstrates how this discipline can make Quebec a better place.\nFirst engineering faculty in Canada named after a woman: Business leader Gina Cody makes historic $15 million donation to Montreal’s Concordia University\nConcordia University researcher partners with Ubisoft to streamline the game development process\nConcordian Matthew Harsh adds empathy and humility to the engineering syllabus\nTeens use math to kill zombies \nConcordia researcher  devises faster and more economical 4D printing of composite materials\nA World First: A UNESCO Chair on the Prevention of Radicalization and Violent Extremism\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nRead more\nNewsmakers archives\nNov.29,2017: Is it adultery if my spouse doesn't recognize me anymore? - Gillian Leithman\nNov.28,2017:\xa0Is it adultery if my spouse doesn’t recognize me anymore? - Gillian Leithman\nNov.27,2017:\xa0L’islamophobie au\xa0Québec depuis le\xa0début du\xa0XXᵉ\xa0siècle - Fred Burrill\nNov.23,2017:\xa0Educate youth so no one will have to say #metoo - James Watts\nNov.22,2017:\xa0Decoding profile pics in Tinder era - Chaim Kuhnreich\nNov.21,2017:\xa0Un siècle de syndicalisme noir à Montréal - Steven High\nNov.20,2017: Train porters and Quebec racism - Steven high\nNov.19,2017:\xa0Les «\xa0cours virtuels\xa0» de\xa0Daech - André Gagné and Marc.André Argentino\nNov.18,2017:\xa0Leonard Cohen, un parcours complexe - Chantal Ringuet\nNov.17,2017: What your Tinder profile pic says about you - Chaim Kuhnreich\nNov.15,2017:\xa0What your Tinder profile pic says about you - Chaim Kuhnreich\nNov.13,2017: Loneliness could kill you - Gillian Leithman\nNov.13,2017:\xa0How should women respond when a man we like is accused of harassment? - Emer O'Toole\nNov.12,2017: Loneliness could kill you - Gillian Leithman\xa0\nNov. 8,2017: Opinion: the true hidden face of bill 62 - Lynda Clark and Afra Jalabi\nNov. 8,2017: Montreal's first female mayor: a new chapter - Harold Chorney\nNov. 7,2017: Montreal's first female mayor: a new chapter - Harold Chorney\nNov. 6,2017:\xa0Islamic State: 'virtual lessons' in loyalty\xa0- André Gagné & Marc-André Argentino\nNov. 5,2017: Islamic State: 'virtual lessons' in loyalty - André Gagné & Marc-André Argentino\nNov. 1,2017: Online hate speech and the Trump effect - Nadia Naffi\xa0\nOct.32,2017: The preacher who changed Europe - Jarrett Carty\nOct.30,2017: The preacher who changed Europe - Jarrett Carty\nOct.30,2017:\xa0RenéLévesque's legacy - Guy Lachapelle\nOct.24,2017: Quebec's niqab ban and the far-right - Yasmin Jiwani\nOct.23,2017: Opinion: Quebec’s niqab ban bolstering the far-right - Yasmin Jiwani\nOct.23,2017: The Jesuits and the\xa0Anishinaabeg in the Soo - Karl Hele\nOct.18,2017: Climate change and the Marshall Islands - Mickael De Souza\nOct.11,2017: The messages we send about women and girls - Desirée de Jesus\nOct.10,2017: Hairy legs, fashion adverts and feminists - Emer O'Toole\nOct. 7, 2017: Can Jagmeet Singh make it in Quebec? - Andrée Gagné\nOct. 6, 2017: Le silence de l'Europe - Antoine Rayroux\nOct. 5, 2017: Catalonia: Europe's silence - Antoine Rayroux\nSept.29,2017: Survivors challenging rape culture with humour - Emer O'Toole\nSept.28,2017: Survivors challenging rape culture with humour - Emer O'Toole\nSept.27,2017: Opinion:\xa0We can topple Ireland’s ludicrous abortion law - Emer O'Toole\nSept.27,2017:\xa0An Indigenous Woman’s View of the National Gallery of Canada - Adrienne Huard\nSept.16,2017:\xa0Keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees: not\xa0impossible - Damon Matthews & Dave Frame\nSept.11,2017: 9/11: understanding extremist motives - André Gagné\nSept.11,2017:\xa0Donald Trump\xa0attise-t-il l’extrémisme de\xa0droite au\xa0Canada\xa0? - André Gagné\nSept.10,2017:\xa09/11 anniversary: Understanding extremist motives - André Gagné\nSept.10,2017: Odd couple in the Soo - Karl Hele\nSept. 8 ,2017: Opinion:\xa0Time to revoke Aung San Suu Kyi's honorary Canadian citizenship - Kyle Matthews\nAug. 31,2017: News covereage of the Charlottesville attack - Muhammed Idris, et.al.\nAug. 30,2017: Are you a pervert?\xa0-\xa0Gonzalo R.
