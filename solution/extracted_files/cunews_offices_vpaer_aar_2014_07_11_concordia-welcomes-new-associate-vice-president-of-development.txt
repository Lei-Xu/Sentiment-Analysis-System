As a volunteer, he co-chaired the Canadian Council for the Advancement of Education’s Prix d’Excellence from 2001 to 2006.\n“In fundraising, we meet people from all walks of life,” he says. “What each has in common, whether they’re making a $25 donation or a $5 million gift, is their commitment to advancing a project that is meaningful to them.”\xa0\n\nA graduate of the Université de Sherbrooke, Dupuis began his career as a physical education teacher. His journey into advancement taught him that education, discipline and coaching are interconnected.\n“If you expect results, actions and personal growth from people, you have to make them understand what you are doing and how they can contribute,” he says, adding everyone can make a difference. \xa0\n“People don’t give to obtain a tax receipt,” he continues. “People give to a cause they believe in.”\nDupuis says working with donors is always exciting. “Each project is different, each donor is different. In all cases, private support enables exceptional projects that are meaningful to donors and the cause they support.”\nIn Dupuis’s previous experience at Concordia, he witnessed the university’s expansion to accommodate a growing body of 46,000 students. He now looks forward to helping the university meet future academic goals.\n“The university has always had the wind in its sails,” he says. “The more people get to know Concordia, the more they are impressed with the quality of education we offer.”\xa0\nBy Sylvain-Jacques Desjardins\nSource: Advancement and Alumni Relations\nConcordia welcomes new associate vice-president of development\nRelated links\nRelated topics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcordia’s Advancement and Alumni Relations\n                                    \n\n\n\n'}
