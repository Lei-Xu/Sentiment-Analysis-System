As our city becomes more directly connected to the world, so too do we expect its overall international reputation to continue to rise.”\nTwo other Canadian cities cracked the top 20 in this year’s rankings: Toronto (tied with Boston at 13th) and Vancouver (17th).\n\xa0\n\nGail Erazo (pursuing a BFA in Studio Art) — Tegucigalpa, Honduras\nI wanted to be in a place where I could learn a third language, where there’s lots to do, somewhere dynamic. And the arts scene was a big factor. The best thing about living here: I feel like I can explore my creativity. People are very open to ideas.\xa0\nStephen Enga (pursuing a BComm in Finance, member of the Institute for Co-operative Education) — Bamenda, Cameroon\nI was drawn to Montreal because I knew it’s a very diverse and bilingual place. Still, I was amazed by the cultural diversity at Concordia. I have friends from Asia, Latin America, all over.\nMassa Berrached (pursuing a BComm in Economics) — Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates\nWhen friends come to visit me in Montreal, I show them around the John Molson School of Business and they are always struck by how nice it is. It’s a good vibe on campus! Everyone is smiling all the time and people are very friendly, open-minded and accepting.\nLenmor Larroza Dimanalata (BCompSc 2018) — Rosario, Cavite, Philippines\nLife in Montreal is an explosion of so many different things! I’m absorbing all this culture everywhere I go. My classmates and my friends represent pretty much all the countries of the world. I’m learning so much about them and I’m learning so much about the world too. I wouldn’t want to live anywhere else.\n\xa0\nSee Concordia's admissions requirements for international students\xa0— and meet students from Africa, the Asia Pacific region, China, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Middle East, and the United States.\n\nMaclean's 2018 Program Rankings: Concordia engineering cracks Canada’s top 10\n\n\nConcordia climbs the 2018 QS World Rankings by Subject\n\n\n‘Our standing in the world has once again been acknowledged’\n\nBy Sarah Buck\n'It's an obvious choice': Montreal is voted the world’s best city for student experience\nRelated topics\nYou might also like:\n\n\n How Concordians from around the world see Montreal\n\n\n\n\nMaclean's 2018 Program Rankings: Concordia engineering cracks Canada’s top 10\n\n\n\n\nConcordia climbs the 2018 QS World Rankings by Subject\n\n\n\n\n‘Our standing in the world has once again been acknowledged’\n\n\n\n"}
