It derives its powers from the Board of Governors and, subject to the latter's over-arching authority, has the final authority in all matters pertaining to the academic regulations and programs of the University. Its powers and functions are listed under article 71 of the By-Laws. Senate is composed of 53 voting members and 11 non-voting members, as outlined in article 62 of the By-Laws.\nSenate meets monthly from September to May, although the President and Vice-Chancellor, in consultation with the Steering Committee, may decide to dispense with a regular meeting.\nThe Agenda and documents are posted before the Senate meeting, while the Minutes of past meetings are maintained by the Records Management and Archives Department.\nSenate conducts its business through its standing committees that report to Senate at regularly scheduled meetings.\nThe information regarding the Senate operating procedures together with other information relevant to members of Senate is included in the Senator's Handbook.\nThe academic affairs of the Faculties (Arts and Science, Engineering and Computer Science, Fine Arts and John Molson School of Business) and the Schools (Graduate Studies and Continuing Education) are conducted by their respective Faculty or School Councils which report to Senate in accordance with the powers set out in their respective mandates.\nThe Annual Report provides members of the Concordia community with information respecting Senate’s role and operations for a given year.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nSenate\nSenate News\nContact us\n\nMeetings, minutes, and standing committees\nSenator's Handbook\nFaculty and School Councils\nAnnual Report\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nFind out who is on Senate\nRead the By-laws\nRead about the Senate's history\nView the Senate meeting schedule\nView the agenda and documents for the current year\nFind out who are the members of the standing committees\nView the standing committees’ meeting schedules and agendas\nLearn about the mandates of the standing committees\nLearn more about Senate through the past minutes\nView the Senator’s Handbook\nLearn more about the mandates of the Faculty Councils\nRead the 2017-2018 Senate annual report\nRead the 2016-2017 Senate annual report\nRead the 2015-2016 Senate annual report\nBoard and Senate AdministrationBoard of GovernorsList of GovernorsMeeting schedulesCurrent membership of standing committeesStanding committee meeting datesGovernor's handbookSenateSenator's handbookList of SenatorsMeeting scheduleCurrent membership of standing committeesStanding committee meeting datesUniversity Charter and By-Laws\nBoard of GovernorsList of GovernorsMeeting schedulesCurrent membership of standing committeesStanding committee meeting datesGovernor's handbook\nList of Governors\nMeeting schedules\nCurrent membership of standing committees\nStanding committee meeting dates\nGovernor's handbook\nSenateSenator's handbookList of SenatorsMeeting scheduleCurrent membership of standing committeesStanding committee meeting dates\nSenator's handbook\nList of Senators\nMeeting schedule\nCurrent membership of standing committees\nStanding committee meeting dates\nUniversity Charter and By-Laws\n\nNovember 19, 2018\nSenate Notes: November 2018\n\n\nOctober 31, 2018\nBoard and Senate Notes: October 2018\n\n\nJuly 18, 2018\nSenate approves a new honours in management program      \n\n\nApril 30, 2018\nBoard and Senate Notes: April 2018\n\n\n\n\nStaff Directory\n                                    \n\n\n\n"}
