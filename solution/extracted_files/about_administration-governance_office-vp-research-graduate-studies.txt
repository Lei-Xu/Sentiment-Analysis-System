That’s why the Office of Vice-President, Research and Graduate Studies (OVPRGS) takes great pride in serving and supporting the university’s researchers. The Office offers an array of services to help dedicated researchers and promote the results of their research — whether it’s maximizing funding opportunities, establishing international research partnerships or guiding them through the university’s policies and procedures.\nManaging more than 100 graduate programs and 6,500 students, the Office also oversees admissions standards and graduation requirements. Since graduate students play a key role in research, the Office provides several services – from application to thesis – to support graduate students.\n\xa0\nVice-President, Research and Graduate Studies\nHeather Adams-Robinette\nDirector, Vice-President, Research and Graduate Studies\xa0Sector\nPaula Wood-Adams\nDean of Graduate Studies\nAndrew Lang\nDirector, Concordia International\nMichèle Thériault\nDirector, Leonard & Bina Ellen Art Gallery\nDirector, Milieux Institute for Arts, Culture and Technology\n\nThrough the\xa0Office of Research, the Vice-President is responsible for research facilitation and promotion, including maximizing research funding opportunities, the development and implementation of policies related to research, technology transfer, and providing a full range of\xa0research services and support\xa0to Concordia researchers.\nThrough the\xa0School of Graduate Studies, students, faculty and administrators are guided through the academic and administrative components of Concordia's graduate programs. The School is also home to the Special Individualized Program, a unique interdisciplinary program that allows outstanding students to create their own program of study, drawing on research interests that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries.\nThrough\xa0Concordia International, the Vice-President plays a leadership role in promoting (international) student mobility as well as international research initiatives.\nThe\xa0Leonard & Bina Ellen Art Gallery\xa0is part of Concordia University and is dedicated to the research, dissemination and critical examination of Canadian and international contemporary art. As part of its programming, it presents exhibitions, provides various educational programs and produces publications. Responsibility for all tasks related to the management, exhibition, research and conservation of the Gallery’s art collection is also part of its mandate.\nThe Milieux Institute for Arts, Culture and Technology is a research unit working at the intersection of design, art, culture and technology. It is a platform for progressive imagining, critical studies, creative experimenting and interdisciplinary training where thinking and making come together to transform our encounter with technology.\nThe PERFORM Centre is a unique facility dedicated to improving health through prevention. The centre combines research, education and community engagement in the areas of physical activity, rehabilitation, nutrition and lifestyle change. PERFORM brings together researchers, students and program participants in a state-of-the-art clinical research facility to create an integrated and comprehensive environment that promotes healthy living.\nFundamentally, the public expects that academics act with integrity, since research is the cornerstone of our profession. At Concordia, we have aligned ourselves to the highest standards set by federal and provincial funding agencies.\nThe research integrity officer provides information, support, training and assistance to scholars in fulfilling all obligations related to principles of ethical conduct.\nThese standards are consistent with the requirements of federal and provincial funding agencies and other sponsors at the university, and are outlined in detail in the Policy for the Responsible Conduct of Research.\nIf you have any questions relating to the integrity research at Concordia, contact Cameron Skinner, research integrity officer, directly and confidentially, at rio@concordia.ca or 514-848-2424, ext. 3341.\n514-848-2424, ext. 4395\n514-848-4010\nConsult our staff directory\nSir George Williams Campus\nGM 900.00 (see map)\n1550 De Maisonneuve Blvd W.\nOffice of VP, Research & Graduate Studies\nSGW Campus, GM 900\n1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W.\nMontreal, Quebec, Canada\nH3G 1M8\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nStrategic Research Plan\nExplore research at Concordia\nThrough the\xa0\n, the Vice-President is responsible for research facilitation and promotion, including maximizing research funding opportunities, the development and implementation of policies related to research, technology transfer, and providing a full range of\xa0\n\xa0to Concordia researchers.\nVisit the Office of Research\nThrough the\xa0\n, students, faculty and administrators are guided through the academic and administrative components of Concordia's graduate programs.
